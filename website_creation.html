                The website creation was a bit less straightforward than I thought it would be which delayed my process a bit, but overall it was a good learning experience. I am excited to see how the website will evolve over the course of the semester. Additionally, I am sure there will need to be many edits made, but I am content with the V1 that is before you. I have very limited coding experience and a large amount of the code is due to GitHub Copilot and especially the help of my peers. I am using VCS to code due to several recommendations.
