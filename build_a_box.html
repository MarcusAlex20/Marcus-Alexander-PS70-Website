            <h2>Building the Box In Fusion 360</h2>
            <p style="width: 80%; margin: auto; text-align: justify; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px;">
                ITERATION 1: Building my finger joint box was very straightforward and allowed me to get a better understanding of how to use CAD Fusion 360. Lessons that I learned were how to use simple shortcuts such as shift + select to grab multiple objects and constrain them to equal. I also became proficient with adding and changing parameters. Additionally, I became very familiar with using construction lines to mirror objects. I became very familiar with the extrude tool and I am excited to see how I can use it later on in the semester. I used the display component tool colors to ensure that the finger joints fit flush. A huge helpful tool that I used was the YouTube video below. At this moment, I have not laser cut my box yet; I will give an additional update once I have done so.
