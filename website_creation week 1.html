            <h2>Website Creation</h2>
            <p> The wesbite creation was a bit less straightforward than I thought it would be which 
                delayed my process a bit, but overall it was a good learning experience. I am excited 
                to see how the website will evolve over the course of the semester. Addiotnally, I am 
                sure there will need to be many edits made, but I am content with the V1 that is before 
                you. I have very limited coding experience and a large amount of the code is due to GITHUB
                Copilot and espeically the help of my peers. I am using VCS to code due to several reccomendations.
